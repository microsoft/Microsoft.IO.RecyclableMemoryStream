# RecyclableMemoryStreamManager.Options.AggressiveBufferReturn property

Whether dirty buffers can be immediately returned to the buffer pool.

```csharp
public bool AggressiveBufferReturn { get; set; }
```

## Remarks

When [`GetBuffer`](../RecyclableMemoryStream/GetBuffer.md) is called on a stream and creates a single large buffer, if this setting is enabled, the other blocks will be returned to the buffer pool immediately.

Note when enabling this setting that the user is responsible for ensuring that any buffer previously retrieved from a stream which is subsequently modified is not used after modification (as it may no longer be valid).
