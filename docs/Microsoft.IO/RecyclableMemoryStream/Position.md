# RecyclableMemoryStream.Position property

Gets the current position in the stream.

```csharp
public override long Position { get; set; }
```

## Exceptions

| exception | condition |
| --- | --- |
| ObjectDisposedException | Object has been disposed. |
| ArgumentOutOfRangeException | A negative value was passed. |
| InvalidOperationException | Stream is in large-buffer mode, but an attempt was made to set the position past the maximum allowed array length. |

## Remarks

If the buffer has already been converted to a large buffer, then the maximum length (and thus position) is limited by the maximum allowed array length in .NET.
