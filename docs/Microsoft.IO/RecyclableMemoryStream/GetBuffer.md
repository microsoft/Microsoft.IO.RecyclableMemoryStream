# RecyclableMemoryStream.GetBuffer method

Returns a single buffer containing the contents of the stream. The buffer may be longer than the stream length.

```csharp
public override byte[] GetBuffer()
```

## Return Value

A byte[] buffer

## Exceptions

| exception | condition |
| --- | --- |
| ObjectDisposedException | Object has been disposed |
| OutOfMemoryException | stream is too large for a contiguous buffer |

## Remarks

IMPORTANT: Doing a [`Write`](Write.md) after calling `GetBuffer` invalidates the buffer. The old buffer is held onto until [`Dispose`](Dispose.md) is called, but the next time `GetBuffer` is called, a new buffer from the pool will be required.
