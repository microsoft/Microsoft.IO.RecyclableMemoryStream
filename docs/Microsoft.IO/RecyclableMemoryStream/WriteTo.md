# RecyclableMemoryStream.WriteTo method (1 of 5)

Writes bytes from the current stream to a destination `byte` array.

```csharp
public void WriteTo(byte[] buffer)
```

| --- | --- |
| ArgumentNullException | *buffer*&gt; is null. |
| ObjectDisposedException | Object has been disposed. |

## Remarks

The entire stream is written to the target array.

# RecyclableMemoryStream.WriteTo method (2 of 5)

Synchronously writes this stream's bytes to the argument stream.

```csharp
public override void WriteTo(Stream stream)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| stream | Destination stream. |

## Exceptions

| exception | condition |
| --- | --- |
| ArgumentNullException | *stream* is null. |
| ObjectDisposedException | Object has been disposed. |

## Remarks

Important: This does a synchronous write, which may not be desired in some situations.
