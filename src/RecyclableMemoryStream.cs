    /// MemoryStream implementation that deals with pooling and managing memory streams which use potentially large
    /// buffers.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// This class works in tandem with the RecyclableMemoryStreamManager to supply MemoryStream
    /// objects to callers, while avoiding these specific problems:
    /// 1. LOH allocations - since all large buffers are pooled, they will never incur a Gen2 GC
    /// 2. Memory waste - A standard memory stream doubles its size when it runs out of room. This
    /// leads to continual memory growth as each stream approaches the maximum allowed size.
    /// 3. Memory copying - Each time a MemoryStream grows, all the bytes are copied into new buffers.
    /// This implementation only copies the bytes when GetBuffer is called.
    /// 4. Memory fragmentation - By using homogeneous buffer sizes, it ensures that blocks of memory
    /// can be easily reused.
    /// 
    /// The stream is implemented on top of a series of uniformly-sized blocks. As the stream's length grows,
    /// additional blocks are retrieved from the memory manager. It is these blocks that are pooled, not the stream
    /// object itself.
    /// 
    /// The biggest wrinkle in this implementation is when GetBuffer() is called. This requires a single 
    /// contiguous buffer. If only a single block is in use, then that block is returned. If multiple blocks 
    /// are in use, we retrieve a larger buffer from the memory manager. These large buffers are also pooled, 
    /// split by size--they are multiples/exponentials of a chunk size (1 MB by default).
    /// 
    /// Once a large buffer is assigned to the stream the small blocks are NEVER again used for this stream. All operations take place on the 
    /// large buffer. The large buffer can be replaced by a larger buffer from the pool as needed. All blocks and large buffers 
    /// are maintained in the stream until the stream is disposed (unless AggressiveBufferReturn is enabled in the stream manager).
